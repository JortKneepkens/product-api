# **Product API — Mechhive Assignment**

This project implements a high-performance product and transaction API with strict <100ms response times, full currency conversion, fee enrichment, Redis-backed caching, and clean modular architecture. It follows engineering principles (SOLID, Clean Architecture, DRY, SoC) and is designed for real-world maintainability and extensibility.

## 🔑 Key Decisions Recap
**Product caching uses key-per-item approach** -
Because it scales better for large catalogs and enables fast random access.

**Currency caching uses Redis Hashes** -
Because we want constant-time lookup for a single rate without reading the entire rate map.

**Enrichment pipeline** -
Because it cleanly supports multiple enrichment steps and future features.

**Strict input validation**- 
Because it prevents domain pollution and makes the API more predictable.

**Custom global exception handler** -
Because it ensures consistent errors and good UX without over-exposing internals.
